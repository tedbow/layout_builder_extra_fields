Just an idea.

# How to Use
* Make a form mode with machine name 'layout_builder_extra_fields'
* Enable it for bundle with layout builder enabled
* Display only the fields you want to show up on layout builder
* These should show up on layout overrides.


Very untested. works for title I guess probably most others.
